Our products boast many features like aesthetics, anti-climb, anti-cut and anti-break, anti-corrode, which makes them suitable for protecting high value assets. Weldmesh fences consist of high quality steel wires welded together forming a mesh structure which creates a strong steel barrier. Weldmesh fences are more rigid as compared to woven fences which adds to high security. Rigid panels help in easy installation as there are hardly any horizontal loads on the poles as compared to woven fences & also require very few accessories for installation. All our weldmesh products are coated in state of the art coating facilities making sure that all the international standards are adhered to so that the finish looks beautiful for a very long time. Consistent high quality welding helps in maintaining the weld strength & mesh size throughout the fence. </p> </div> <div class="products"> <div class="product product-1"> <h2>SS (Stainless Steel) Welded Wiremesh</h2> <div class="content"> <div class="product-img product-img__1"> <div class="img-placeholder"> <img src="ss (1).311b1407.jpg" alt="ss"> </div> </div> <p class="product-desc product-desc__1"> Stainless steel welded wire mesh is strong and long lasting due to its excellent corrosion resistance in a wide variety of chemical and industrial atmospheres. Type 316 is recommended for salt water environments since it has a higher resistance to corrosion than Type 304. For designing the storage and racking for the warehouses, stainless steel Welded Wire Mesh is used as it enables higher durability despite the challenging environments. This Welded Wire Mesh can be used to beat the challenges that are linked with warehouse spaces exposure to environmental elements. Due to its zinc structure, the component protects the products it provides against rust. This is a very important feature. Because galvanized wire mesh is used as a garden fence or as a wire mesh fence to provide border security. It should not rust during cold weather or when exposed to moisture. This product is widely used in industry, agriculture, farming, construction, transportation, mining and so on. Such as machine enclosures, animal livestock fence, flowers fence, window guardrail, channel fence, poultry cage, egg baskets and home office food basket, paper basket and decoration. This is by a combination of heavy electric current (applied at low voltage) passed through the junction of wires, combined with heavy mechanical pressure. All the spacings between wires are controlled by an automatic mechanism of high reliability. </p> </div> </div> <div class="product product-2"> <h2>GI (Galvanized Iron) Welded Wiremesh</h2> <div class="content"> <div class="product-img product-img__1"> <div class="img-placeholder"> <img src="1.4d1c4647.jpg" alt="gi"> </div> </div> <p class="product-desc product-desc__1"> This weld mesh is a mesh made by welding wires usually placed perpendicular to each other forming rectangular or square shapes.
